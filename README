particular, nsstats provides information about e.g.
  - cache usage
  - configuration parameters
  - mutex lock statistics
  - nsv lock statistics
  - runtime statistics from the virtual server(s) and pool(s)
  - scheduled procedures
  - threads
  - web-access to 
    * configuration file
    * last entries from error.log

Changes since 1.0

  - actual configuration parameters
  - per-server and per-pool information in process statistics
  - queueing and spooling statistics
  - queuing time/filter time runtime per pool
  - more detailed cache statistics (e.g. saved times)
  - access to configuration file 
  - max wait, total wait, total lock time, avg lock time
  - nsv locks (mapping from variable names to buckets and locks)
  - threads: added user time, system times, processor number and state
    (Linux only)

      By default it is disabled, if set to 1 this pages can be accessed to see 
      runtime statistics
